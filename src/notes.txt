-- two options available: registered-based or ets-based dispatching

-- get/put and base init are all generic operations to be split into a behaviour

-- the initial supervision needs to start N of them at once and be able to return the config on demand

- the pool isn't an app, but must be possible to fit
 under a supervision tree. Although it should be possible for it to have its own supervision tree. If you depend on it, you use it.
